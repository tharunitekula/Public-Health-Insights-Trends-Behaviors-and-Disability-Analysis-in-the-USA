# Public-Health-Insights-Trends-Behaviors-and-Disability-Analysis-in-the-USA

**Project Overview:**
This project presents a series of interactive Tableau dashboards designed to analyze and visualize U.S. public health trends by integrating behavioral, chronic disease, and disability data. The goal is to uncover key insights about lifestyle risk factors such as smoking and obesity, their relationships with chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease, and health disparities across demographic groups and states. The dashboards support data-driven decision-making for health interventions and policies.

**Data Sources:**
The project combines and cleans information from multiple authoritative public health datasets:

Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) – Lifestyle risk factors and behavioral health metrics.
CDC Chronic Disease Indicators – Prevalence of chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.
CDC Disability & Demographic Data – Disability rates and demographics by race, age, gender, and state.

**Dashboards Overview:**
The project includes five interactive dashboards with distinct focuses:

Public Health Insights Dashboard: Regional exploration of chronic diseases and behavioral risks across U.S. states.
Behavioral Health Insights Dashboard: Analysis of mental health trends and their correlation with chronic illnesses and lifestyle risks.
Disability Insights Dashboard: Examination of disability prevalence across races, age groups, and genders highlighting disparities.
Chronic Disease Impact Dashboard: Identification of states with highest chronic disease burdens and associated risk factors.
Health Trends Over Time Dashboard: Visualization of changes in behavioral factors and chronic conditions from 2018 to 2023.

**Tools Used:**
**Tableau:** Creation of interactive dashboards and storytelling through data visualization
**Microsoft Excel:** Data cleaning, formatting, integration, and preparation for analysis

**Key Findings:**
66% of respondents are overweight or obese, contributing to increased chronic disease prevalence.
More than 42,000 preventive screening tests are missed, indicating gaps in healthcare access.
Significant health disparities exist, such as a 19% disability rate among Black non-Hispanics compared to 1% for Pacific Islanders.

**Challenges Faced:**
Data inconsistencies including varied state name formats across datasets.
Missing values, particularly in self-reported BRFSS survey responses.
Complex data merging requirements due to multiple datasets from different sources, years, and states.

**Conclusion:**
This project delivers a comprehensive and dynamic visualization platform to explore U.S. public health data, highlighting critical health behaviors, chronic disease impacts, and inequalities. It enables stakeholders to engage deeply with the data and supports targeted interventions for improved public health outcomes.
